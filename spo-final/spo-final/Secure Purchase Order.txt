Secure Purchase Order: 


Implement a secure purchase order system that allows the user to enter a purchase request and routes it to a supervisor for signature and then to the purchasing department. 


The signatures of both the purchaser and the supervisor will be public key based, and will be performed on a hash of the purchase order. 


The signature of the purchaser will be sent to both the supervisor and the orders department along with a timestamp. 


If an order is approved by the supervisor, the orders department can crosscheck the digest signed by the supervisor with the digest signed by the purchaser. 


All messages will be encrypted using RSA public-key cryptography.
